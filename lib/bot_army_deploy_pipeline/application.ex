defmodule BotArmyDeployPipeline.Application do
  @moduledoc """
  Deploy Pipeline Bot application supervisor.

  Follows bot army pattern with environment-aware startup:
  - Repo not started in :test (tests inject mocks)
  - PulsePublisher sends `system.health` liveness every 30s and rich `bot.<service>.pulse` every 30 minutes
  - Workers not started in :test (gated by @env)

  Observability: see `PulsePublisher` — fleet UIs keyed on Synapse hydration should use `system.health` freshness (90s), not pulse interval alone.
